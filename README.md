# Set up React calling API

## Setting up react app
1. Created react app using create-react-app (library).  
   Command was npx create-react-app acebook-frontend
2. Move to that directory
3. Run npm start to boot server
4. Open browser then react welcome message appears

## Creating a table
1. Created folder under src called ‘components’
2. Created a table file in that folder called Table.js
3. Within Table.js we required react
4. We created a constant called Table which runs a function (?) that returns html for a table
5. Within that table are the headers and the rows are pulled through using the API keys
6. Put a loading message when data not yet loaded (line 28)
7. Line 34 exports table somewhere

## Fetching the API data in App.js
1. Require react and table.js
2. Created a class which extends component ?
3. Set instance variable with ‘users’ array line 8
4. We fetched the data from a dummy api
5. Return the Table users using the instance variable for users.  

Then the data shows on localhost: 3000

Bootstrap can be used to improve the table formatting further




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
